ideas for templates

given some template
  <template>
     <template item="needs some item">
       <template item="needs some subitem. how do I cascade items from out to in?"></template>
     </template>
   </template>

and a target destination

   <div>
     Title
     <div item="item is just some data that is used by the templating engine as context" fill_with="template_name"
        template_args="{key:value,key1:value1}"
     >
   </div>


$.yote.util.template

could just store the templates as strings and edit them. Could build in a template editor then, too. just give the 
editor some test values and it will render with those values as you edit, as long as the change has valid html

welcome_template( context ) : 

  Hello $user.name, How are you? I see your email is $user.email
      You have the following messages :
           $$list_template( { item in user.email_list } )



list_template( item ) :
   item.foo | item.bar | $$baz_templte( { item } )
