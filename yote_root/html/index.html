	<H1>What is Yote</H1>
      </DIV>	    
      <P>Yote is a web application server,
	a set of perl libraries and, a set of javascript libraries. It is
	designed for the rapid development of web applications. This website is run from a yote
	server as are all the apps that appear on this site.
      </P>
      <P>
	Yote objects are container objects organized in a tree that are automatically saved by the server and
	require no table definitions. A master process runs yote methods and is the only process that can touch 
	the backend datastore (currently SQLite, but drivers can be made for other data stores).
      </P>
      <P>
	Yote is just venturing as an alpha release. This means that, while there are test programs to make sure it is doing its job,
	there are likely bugs that the test program does not yet test for. It means that not all features have been created even if
	they are planned.
      </P>

	<H2>Who is Yote for</H2>
      </DIV>	    
      <P>
	Yote is for the Impatient; those people who want to code the business logic and object to object relationships without
	having to muck about writing table schemas.
	<BR>
	Yote is for someone who wants to put a prototype of a web application together in short order.
