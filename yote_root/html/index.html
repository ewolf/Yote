      </DIV>
      <P>Yote is a web application server written in perl and javascript. It is
	designed for the rapid development of web applications. 
      </P>
      <p>
	Yote manages persistant objects in a graph structure containing a root node. It can also be used as a web server itself.
	The objects are automatically saved and cached. The datastore can be one of Mongo, SQLite and MySQL. Mongo is the 
	favored and fastest data store for Yote.
      </P>
      <p>
	Yote has just entered its alpha release phase, meaning it's in feature freeze. It also means that 
	the installer kinks need to be worked out post haste and a big bughunt begins.
	This website is dogfooding Yote, meaning that all pages and apps on the site are run from a Yote server.

      <ul>
	<LI><strong>MVC :</strong> the model is created transparently and has much less an overt footprint in the code. This means you mainly focus on the controller and model.</LI>
	<LI><strong>Schema gone :</strong> you change data structures on the fly and on a case by case basis.</LI>
	<LI><strong>Synchronous :</strong> the javascript calls are synchronous by default, but can be called asynchronous as well. The code then flows from one statement to the next without needing to chain lots of asycnronous calls.</LI>
