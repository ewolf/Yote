This thing has to be an END to END programming solution.

We will host the application server. People will be able to log in and create their own applications. 
This will be desired by Google or others.

We will write a new language for the app server. 

* It will be a simple container language
* It will have math and string manipulations
* It will look somewhat like python
* It will be written in perl at least at first
* It will have versioning
* You get a devel instance free, then if you pay, you get 
  - devel (as many as you like)
  - staging
  - live

Out of the box : CPAN Yote && yote_server 
Then fire up your browser to localhost:8080 and go.

There will be some bootstrap HTML inside the classes.
Other than the bootstrap, the interfaces will be stored within Yote.

IF IT DOESNT FEEL RIGHT OR COMFORTABLE, IT PROBABLY ISNT RIGHT
 - so, not using the filesystem for html pages feels good
 - perl is TIMTOWTDI, but this is OWTDI
