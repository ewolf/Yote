This document descripes the idioms used with yote.

Builtin Yote commands
  These commands are provided for all Yote interactions :

 - login
 - create_account
 - fetch : fetches object. the client creates a javascript object analog (or avatar or whatever) of it.
           yote does not allow one app to fetch data for an other app. The app itself can extend
	   the fetch function to provide further object security, but cannot override the app object 
	   ownership check.
 - stow : saves the object. yote does not allow one app to stow data for an other app.

Other commands are defined by the indivual G App.


Data between client and server

Messages from the server to the client are in the form :

  {
    a => G App in question,
    c => command for app,
    d => data for app,
    t => login token,
    w => boolean instructing yote to wait for command to complete before returning,
  }

Messages returned from the server to the client are of the form :
  {
    msg => 'optional message',
    t   => login token (returned by create_account and login),
    r   => return data,
  }
