The Phases :
  * GET IT WORKING        Alpha 0
  * GET IT CORRECT        Alpha 1
  * GET IT COMPREHENSIBLE Alpha 2
  * GET IT FAST           Alpha 3
  * GET IT PRETTY         Alpha 4

Currently wrapping up phase Alpha 1 and making headway on Alpha 2


Next updates
  * For cron, a repeat_special - something like 'first tuesday of the month or something like that' ( can deal with this much later )
  * implement validation request
  * make into daemon if possible. did not have much luck with this before
  * try/catch on the javscript side. dump the cache should there be exceptions that would warrent that.
  * check to see if recycling needs the rest shut down.
  * clean up widgets to make sure tag id fields are unique. prep_edit, for example, does not guarantee this
  * review all methods and classes and remove those that no longer fit
  -* Indexing for lists always starts at 0...no jumping around with undefs? Agreed. Done and done.
  x* Cron - make scheduled_times a list of objects with 'time' and 'note' fields.
  * add comments for crons
  * table for scalar list entries
  * bug : undefined showing up for undefined me.prefix_classname
  * add tests for list_insert, list_delete, hash_insert, hash_delete
  * test for pagination in unit_tests.html
  * make sure dirty is marked for list_insert, list_delete, hash_insert, hash_delete. (add a dirty_if_present?)
  x* consider moving this list to github for tracking. ( this is always here. just need discipline to do it)
  * control_table to work with the cool built in pagination that objects already have!
  -* make sure search and sort fields can both be given. update the tests for that.
  -* Permissions updates
      * . Consider with the LOCK_MODE change below. Maybe the default should be make things as permissive as 
          possible and the user can override that permissivity, possibly with a set of tags or conditions to allow the thing to happen.
    	  with a double underscore as the reserved space for this __. The goal for this is ease of programming. Maybe the default is
    	  the object creator or root can edit it. CRUD permissions? Or use the subclassing below ( or even configuring with __ )
        * configuration for LOCK_MODE
	-* new subclasses for Yote::Obj, one that allows anyone to update its fields, and the other that allows only root to - these should supplant creating some objects. may be made moot with the permissiveness above
  -* add_to, remove_from, delete_key - Obj methods to allow for list or hash manipulation off of this object. Will work only for root if _ is the first letter
  -* count for searches! This is missing and makes control_table buggy.
  x* Exclusive cron. Means cron entry must have a unique name and that by default only one of that name may be run at once.
  * Update how logging is done. Access log and error log like apache. Capture STDERR and collect to error log
  x* changed permissions model so that YoteRoot checks if accounts are root. (won't do it now)
  * Document all the widgets
  -* complete test cases for hash pagination
  * MongoIO pagination update - use different collection for large tables
  * for mongo db, maybe do a separate collection for list parts. When a list is too big, maybe its object nodes uses this other collection to split the list.
  * control_table sort
  - * Control table : make sure that html tags it creates have appropriate classes. Use the new 'prefix_classname' variable
  -* for control_table, show showing a-n of y numbering.
  x* caching of paginated lists ( wont do now )
  -* update control table widget to use new paginate
  -* search_hash for all IO types, as well as tests for it ( just one sort )
  -* add sort for control table for Mongo and Mysql
  -* unify sort, search and pagination


FOR Stable Alpha

 -* add option to yote_server to do a full reconfiguring of the server
 -* deadlock test cases
 -* cache clearning test cases
  * Add object versioning? Store a new field in the database : version. Then _load can be used to check the version.
  * Add timing alarm and max execute length parameter for configuration ( though use something other than sleep, a watchdog thread maybe
 -* Move MongoIO, etc, to an IO sub package
 ?x* refactor IO to include better back references. Object will have to take note. ( again, maybe not with the new paginate )
 -* Enable Cron
  - Move encrypt_pass to somewhere self, maybe? Moved to ObjProvider
  * Security improvement : offer up proxies for other users' accounts. This makes sure that
     the client does not access account data it shouldn't
  * Create admin pages
 -* Unify unit tests for different stores
 -* Create program to reset root password
 -* Create program to reset whole config ( code for this is done as part of Yote.pm )
  * More yote tools
  * Add at least simple modperl support. Maybe use plack?
  * UI - account change password and request password reset link
  * method to get version to client
 -* add test only requirements to Build.PL
 -* include app class rather than app id in the IO


#----------- Pre Aril 2013 ----
# 
# the following list may contain items done
#

FOR ALPHA

  -* Enable caching that pays attention to who has what.
  -* Make guest tokens required for running any non-root app command.
  -* Create yote admin page for
        -* viewing apps
        -* viewing user login objects
        -* cron admin
  * Create guest page to be hosted at madyote.com
  - * Make installer work for the common case of user having root. [ done, needs testing ]
  -* Have server respond to javascript permissions requests. ( this is now moot )
  * Fix page counter
  - * Make simple WIKI for updating Yote News
  - * installer so that other scripts work (rename them to yote_ )

BEYOND

* have methods sent just once per class
* add GRU module for searches against tag lists
* update to not use backticks
- * make sure installer script works universally ( well, windows fails due to threads :( )
- * build yote homepage
* build page editor
* yote objects that bridge to files an allow for editing.
- * replace Crypt:Passwd with something better.
