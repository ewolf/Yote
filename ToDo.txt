Next updates
  * Update how logging is done. Access log and error log like apache. Capture STDERR and collect to error log
  * changed permissions model so that YoteRoot checks if accounts are root
  * Document all the widgets
  * complete test cases for hash pagination
  * MongoIO pagination update - use different collection for large tables
  * review all methods and classes and remove those thta no longer fit
  * control_table sort
  - * Control table : make sure that html tags it creates have appropriate classes. Use the new 'prefix_classname' variable
  -* for control_table, show showing a-n of y numbering.
  x* caching of paginated lists ( wont do now )
  -* update control table widget to use new paginate
  -* search_hash for all IO types, as well as tests for it ( just one sort )
  -* add sort for control table for Mongo and Mysql
  -* unify sort, search and pagination

* for mongo db, maybe do a separate collection for list parts. When a list is too big, maybe its object nodes uses this other collection to split the list.

FOR Stable Alpha

 - * add option to yote_server to do a full reconfiguring of the server
 - * deadlock test cases
 - * cache clearning test cases
  * Add object versioning? Store a new field in the database : version. Then _load can be used to check the version.
  * Add timing alarm and max execute length parameter for configuration ( though use something other than sleep, a watchdog thread maybe
  -* Move MongoIO, etc, to an IO sub package
  * refactor IO to include better back references. Object will have to take note. ( again, maybe not with the new paginate )
  -* Enable Cron
 - Move encrypt_pass to somewhere self, maybe? Moved to ObjProvider
  * Security improvement : offer up proxies for other users' accounts. This makes sure that
     the client does not access account data it shouldn't
  * Create admin pages
  * Unify unit tests for different stores
 - * Create program to reset root password
 - * Create program to reset whole config ( code for this is done as part of Yote.pm )
  * More yote tools
  * Add at least simple modperl support. Maybe use plack?
  * UI - account change password and request password reset link
  * method to get version to client
 - * add test only requirements to Build.PL
 - include app class rather than app id in the IO
