Make sure to correctly copy :
  * yote_server
  * lock_server
  * yote_cgi.pl (also, to write the use lib part of this)

Clustered Yote Servers (Pack?)

Configure ---> 
   All Nodes :
      list (order is important) of all node ips/ports
   Single node :
      node specific config
      which node number this is!

Better error returns, so that die can return something meaningful back to the client.

Security Questions:
  * use SSL?
  * With restful, the URL could be snooped even with SSL.
    Maybe move the token and the path to the POST data

  -- on cookies or local storage :
       store some information in the account object, like login time, login ip, time of last use
       have a maximum time the login is valid for (both inactive timeout and absolute timeout)
       

write POD

write tests ( similar to Lock::Server )




--done -- 
   serve the js file from yote itself
   add __ for web
   have this be its own backup html server as well. @wheee
   add token creation/verification
   create yote_server script
   create useful objects like accounts or logins
   confiure options beyond root ( port for yote, port for lock server, timeout, etc )
