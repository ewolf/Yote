Security Questions:
  * use SSL?
  * With restful, the URL could be snooped even with SSL.
    Maybe move the token and the path to the POST data

write POD

write tests ( similar to Lock::Server )

confiure options beyond root ( port for yote, port for lock server, timeout, etc )

create yote_server script

create useful objects like accounts or logins

--done -- 
   serve the js file from yote itself
   add __ for web
   have this be its own backup html server as well. @wheee
   add token creation/verification
