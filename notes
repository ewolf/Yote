Having a performance issue with multiple processing threads :


with 3 processing threads
   tests completed in 478 ms

with 2 processing threads
   tests completed in 458 ms

with 1 processing thread
   tests completed in 177 ms

# ------- have updated the threads model to test a new way

) well, it is certainly an improvement

with 3 processing threads
    tests completed in 325 ms

with 3 processing threads
    tests completed in 328 ms

with 1 processing thread
    tests completed in 195 ms

# --------- just processing threads, no server threads
   ( 10 processes )

   tests completed in 217 ms

   with no cache :
      tests completed in 191 ms
